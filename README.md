# Office Dog Manager

## Purpose

To allow dog owners and management to monitor and measure the participation of employees in a dog-friendly workplace.

## Inspiration

I worked in an office where only seven (7) dogs were permitted to come to work on any given day.  As the business grew, it was necessary to come up with a way for employees to plan dog visits in advance and for management to understand which dogs were coming on which days and how often.  

## LICENSE

I am not all that interested in marketing or sales, so I designed this intending it to be a document others could copy and work on.  Then again, I would be very irritated if someone just incorporated this into something they then copyright and sell.  So, I want to make sure this is licensed so if you do any work with it, you share it with the public.  This is as of June 21, 2018 (Summer Solstice) and I may change my mind once more work has been done.  The current license terms can be found in the document named LICENSE.txt.

## How to Install

## Designer Notes
